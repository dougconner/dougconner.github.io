Notes on my Resume project:

1. I have moved the footer contact information up with the other bio information.
I think having the contact information below the map makes it less accessible.
The layout looks better this way too.

2. I have added a navigation feature that lets you toggle the Work, Projects, and
Education sections on/off for easier navigation.

3. I have added information to the map marker infoWindows to show the company name for
places I've worked, the school name for schools, and the where I live. These are in
addition to the city, state, and lat-lon information.
